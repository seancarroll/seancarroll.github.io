# 2019 Goals

I can't think of a better way to start acting on one of my goals, hint: blogging, then to kick off 2019 with a goals list.

## Travel

I haven't done much travel and I'm looking to change that in 2019. I'll be heading to New Orleans for a few days in April which is a good start. I'd like to plan two additional trips. One being a weekend gateway and another being for a longer vacation.

## Self Care

A few goals concerning self care

### Exercise

While I don't plan to purchase a gym membership there are plenty of things I can do at home. Once the weather turns my goal is to run at twice a week. Plus a colleague of mine does yoga so maybe I'll attend a few of those.

### Better Eats

This really just comes down to a few items
- More fruits and vegtables 
- Drink more water, tea, macha
- Drink less sugary drinks primarily decrease the amount of Coke and Mountian Dew
- Eat less sweets and candy

### More Sleep

I do a horrible job at getting a consistent amount of sleep. Technically, I've already started the year out poorly as I was sleepy by 9PM but by the time I was finished prepping for bed I was no longer in the mood and ended up staying up until midnight and woke up at 6AM. Goal is to try and get closer to 8 hours a night of shut eye.

## Read

Over the last few years I've started to read more which is partially driven by my girlfriend as we'll read the same book at the same time flipping between us on who chooses the book. Even with that, I still only get through a few books a year.

I probably won't get through all of these but books on my 2019 reading list in alphabetial order
- Cloud Native Java
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications
- Domain Driven Design (Blue Book)
- Doom
- How To Win Friends And Influence People
- It Doesn't Have to be Crazy At Work
- Microservices for Everyone
- Remote
- Thinking In Systems
- Wolfenstein

## Open Source

In 2018 I started actively working on a few personal side projects which includes
- FoundationDB Event Store https://github.com/seancarroll/fdb-java-es
- https://github.com/seancarroll/jmediator
- https://github.com/seancarroll/jSQLStreamStore

 I also made my first contribution to an open source project https://github.com/lmdbjava/lmdbjava

For 2019 I want to finish the projects above as well as 

contribute to others (spring / rocksdb / lmdbjava)

## Business

<!-- TODO: add content -->

## Community Participation

Chicago Java User Group / Chicago Tech Slack / DDD-CQRS-ES / others?

I've been actively attending Meetups in 2018 but have usually kept to myself as I'm generally I'm a shy person.

## Blogging

I've included this as a goal since 2016 which I actually set this blog up on GitHub pages but I've never made much progress. While writing this I look at the items under my `_drafts` folder I have 11 potential blog post ideas but none are close to being finished. Maybe this year...

## Streaming 

Try my hand at streaming on twitch. I bought some equipment last year and attempted to stream however I ran into a slight issue. I currently get my internet from my apartment complex and discovered that they are blocking twitch. More specifically, it looks like they are blocking a specific protocol. To verify I tried a few remote locations and I didn't have any issues. This might also be the reason why HQ video doesn't work while I'm on my WiFi. This leaves a few potential options A) drop the internet provided by my building and start paying for it myself. B) Stream from work on my off hours. C) Stream over a VPN
