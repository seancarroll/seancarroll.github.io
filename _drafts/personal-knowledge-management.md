Over the last few years I've made several attempts to make writing more of a habit. 
Specifically, I've attempt to try and keep daily personal notes but it never sticks. 
I tried the [Archer Day Planner](http://www.theactivesystem.com/users-guide) and used it for a few days but inevitably I miss a day which turned into missing a few days in a row and within 2 or 3 weeks I gave up on it. 
I briefly looked at [Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/) but never actually tried it. 
I've never stuck with any of these writing systems/methodologies long enough to form a habit.
The only consistent personal writing I've done is randomly jotting stuff in one of my [Moleskines](https://us.moleskine.com/notebooks/classic/0201-2) which I absolutely love. 
The problem of course is that these notes arent organized, searchable or otherwise discoverable. 

{% capture bb_moleskine %}
<p>B&B: Did you know Moleskine has smart writing products that might help with those issues?</p>
<p>Me: I did and while I'm not looking to purchse any additional products that see something I should consider looking at again and could be a worthwhile investment.</p>
{% endcapture %}
{% include block-and-bobble.html content=bb_moleskine %}

As a result, I tend to end up writing short lived notes that I only need to come back to within a short timeframe. 
Generally these end up being reminders or TODO lists.

I was scrolling through Twitter the other day when I saw this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sigh <a href="https://t.co/nZFosrqzKW">pic.twitter.com/nZFosrqzKW</a></p>&mdash; steveklabnik (@steveklabnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1279141392800010240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Reading through the thread I see that he's starting to use a product called [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and he moved away from [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). 
He also mentioned [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
Knowing nothing about any of these things, I start opening up a crap ton of tabs, which I'm known to do. 
I click the link in the tweet and right out the gate Foam mentions Roam. 
Right click open new tab. 
Couple of Google searches for Zettlr and Obsidian and a few more tabs.

While there are an abundance of note taking apps out there, what initially struck me is that these products aren't just about taking notes. 
Instead, they are about [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). 
The Roam Research [white paper](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/Vu1MmjinS) is certainly worth a read. 
At the core its about surfacing a knowledge graph made possible by [wiki-links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link). TODO: building context.
More then that, the real key is that these links are bi-directional with the automatic creation of backlinks.  
<!-- TODO: Flush this out a bit more.  -->

My research also lead me a bit into the weeds with [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), map of context (MOC), and even this [starter kit](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/imf-v3-advanced-starter-kit/390).
All of these are some next level shit. 
As someone who's trying to simply get started these are far too advanced for me. 
I'm make sure to include them and add links and hopefully circle back to them in the future.

{% include rubber-duck.html content="Do you remember the way out?" %}

All this research has invigorated me to give this another go. 
Heck, I even decided to blog about it so that in itself is a good first step.

Roam is a monthly subscription and I'm not yet ready to drop $15 on something that I may only use a few times so I started to take a closer look at some free alternatives. 
Below is a simple comparison matrix based on my initial basic research.

{:class="table table-bordered"}
|          | Backlinks | Graph | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Foam     | Yes       | Yes   |  Built on VSCode which I already use. Extensions for graph and backlinks however I dont love the backlinks explorer. No automatic backlink creation but is on the roadmap. Overall project is in its ery early stages. |
| Zettlr   | No        | No    |       |
| Obsidian | Yes       | Yes   | While doesnt include automatic insertion of backlink into the note it does provide a backlinks section |

Zettlr doesn't support the features I'm looking for so that's out. 
I like the direction Foam is going but it feels a wee bit early for me.  
As of right now, Obsidian hits the sweet spot for me however I starred Foam on GitHub and will be checking in on over the next few months to see how they are progressing. 

Now the hard part, how to start? 
Whelp, I think a good place to start is about this!
I also have some notes on a few books I have that I plan to more over. 
I think thats a good place to start and we'll go from there.

Before you go, I also stumbed upon the following which I was very impressed by.

Hopefully catch you again on a back link.
