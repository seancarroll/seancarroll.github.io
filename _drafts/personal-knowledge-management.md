# Personal Knowledge Management

// Rubber duck
// alter ego personality (a bit like fasterthanlime cool bear)
// tangent
// last sentence is a pun referencing something in the article

Over the last few years I've made several attempts to make writing more of a habit. 
Specifically, I've attempt to try and keep daily personal notes but it never sticks. 
I tried the [Archer Day Planner](http://www.theactivesystem.com/users-guide) and the used it for a few days but inevitably I miss a day which turns into missing a few days in a row and within 2 or 3 weeks I gave up on it. 
I briefly looked at [Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/) but never actually tried it. 
The only consistent personal writing I've done is randomly jotting stuff in one of my [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/notebooks/classic/0201-2) which I absolutely love. 
The problem of course is that these notes arent organized, searchable or otherwise discoverable. 
// TODO: mention that I am aware of Moleskin smart writing products.
As a result what I end up writing are short lived notes that I only need to come back to within a short timeframe. 
Generally these end up being reminders or TODO lists.
Anything longer then that I move elsewhere.


something about repittion for couple of weeks to become habit.


whelp i'm going it another go.

Saw this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sigh <a href="https://t.co/nZFosrqzKW">pic.twitter.com/nZFosrqzKW</a></p>&mdash; steveklabnik (@steveklabnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1279141392800010240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Reading through the thread I see that he's starting to use a product called [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and he moved away from [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). 
He also mentioned [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
Knowing nothing about any of these things, I start opening up a crap ton of tabs, which I'm known to do. 
I click the link in the tweet and right out the gate Foam mentions Roam. 
Right click open new tab. 
Couple of Google searches for Zettlr and Obsidian and a few more tabs.

*cracks knuckles* here we go...

While there are an abundance of note taking apps out there, what initially struck me is that these products aren't just about taking notes. 
Instead, they are about [personal knowledge management(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). 
At the core its about surfacing a knowledge graph made possible by [wiki-links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link). TODO: building context.
More then that, the real key is that these links are bi-directional with the automatic creation of backlinks.

- Map Of Context (MOC)

This is some next level shit. 
As someone who's trying to just get started this is far too advanced for me. 
I'm make sure to include them and add links and hopefully circle back to them in the future.

// do you remember the way out?


TODO: transition to me decided to give this a whirl. 
All this research has invigorated me to give So this is exciting

I'm not yet ready to drop $15 on something that I may only use a few times so I started to take a closer look at some free alternatives. 
Below is a simple comparison matrix based on my initial basic research.

|          | Backlinks | Graph | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Foam     | Yes       | Yes   |  Built on VSCode which I already use. Extension for graph and backlinks however I dont love the backlinks explorer. No automatic backlink creation but is on the roadmap. Overall project is in its ery early stages. |
| Zettlr   | No        | No    |       |
| Obsidian | Yes       | Yes   | While doesnt include automatic insertion of backlink into the note it does provide a backlinks section |


Zettlr doesn't support the features I'm looking for so that's out. 
I like the direction Foam is going but it feels a wee bit early for me.  
As of right now, Obsidian hits the sweet spot for me however I starred Foam on GitHub and will be checking in on over the next few months to see how they are progressing.
