For my first blog post I want to thank all of the individuals who have created content regarding all things
software development. Whether you are an author, OSS contributer, speaker, blogger, screencaster, answer questions
on stackoverflow, or contribute in any other number of ways; I want to say thank you. Thank you for teaching me,
for provoking me, for stimutating me, and for entertaining me.

# Option 1
I'm a huge fan of technical articles, blogs, and videos. I initially started reading them while at univeristy but it 
wasn't until I begain working as a professional software developer that it became something I truly loved.
Now a good percentage of my free time is spent reading technical articles, blogs as well as watching
technical talks. [Ditch this sentence?]
