For my first post I want to give a shout out of all of the individuals who create free openly available software development content.
Whether you are an author, OSS contributer, speaker, blogger, screencaster, answer questions on stackoverflow.com, or contribute in any other number of ways; I want to say thank you. 
Thank you for teaching me, for provoking me, for stimutating me, and for entertaining me.

Cheers and a tip of the hat
