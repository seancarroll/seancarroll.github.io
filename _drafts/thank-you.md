For my first blog post I want to thank all of the individuals who have created content regarding all things
software development. Whether you are an author, OSS contributer, speaker, blogger, screencaster, answer questions
on stackoverflow, or contribute in any other number of ways; I want to say thank you. Thank you for teaching me,
for provoking me, for stimutating me, and for entertaining me.
